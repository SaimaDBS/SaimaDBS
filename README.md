## **Textile Fabric Defect Detection Machine Learning Algorithm using Images Dataset Multiclassification**

In textile industry, manual fabric quality inspection is a challenging task. Incomplete and faulty inspection compromises cost and quality of the product.This research successfully developed a simple, fast Convolutional Neural Network machine learning algorithm using different sampling techniques. It was experimented on three different sizes of images i.e., 200x800, 150x700 and 245x345.The size that gave the best performance with a particular sampling technique was selected. Prinicpal Component Analysis was used for data visualization.

##**Analysis of the factors affecting life expectancy in developing and developed countries with Regression Model using data preprocessing, features selection and its evaluation** <br> <\br>
The analysis of the dataset taken from kaggle involved finding variables with major impact on the life expectancy factor of the humans. Analysing and predicting the variables with the aim to study the relationship and to determine the extent to which the variables like adult mortality, smoking, different disease variables affect life expectancy. This also involved predicting and determine whether economic factors have also an impact on the life expectancy. The whole task was done my means of finding the correlation among the variables.
