## **Selected projects in data science, machine learning**
In textile industry, manual fabric quality inspection is a challenging task. Incomplete and faulty inspection compromises cost and quality of the product.This research successfully developed a simple, fast Convolutional Neural Network machine learning algorithm using different sampling techniques. It was experimented on three different sizes of images i.e., 200x800, 150x700 and 245x345.The size that gave the best performance with a particular sampling technique was selected. Prinicpal Component Analysis was used for data visualization.
